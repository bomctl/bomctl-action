__bomctl__ is format-agnostic Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tooling, which is intended to bridge the gap between SBOM generation and SBOM analysis tools. It focuses on supporting more complex SBOM operations on multiple SBOM files that represent systems by being opinionated on only supporting the [NTIA minimum fields](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf) or other fields supported by [protobom](https://github.com/protobom/protobom).

> [!NOTE]
> [bomctl](https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl) is an experimental project under active development. We'd love feedback on the concept, scope, and architecture!

This action installs `bomctl` and optionally:

- runs one or more `bomctl` commands
- exports the resulting SQLite database content as either a SQL script or JSON data

For a quick start guide on the usage of `bomctl`, please refer to <https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl-playground>.
For available `bomctl` releases, see <https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/releases>.

## Usage

This action currently supports GitHub-hosted Linux, macOS and Windows runners (self-hosted runners may not work).

Add the following entry to your Github workflow YAML file:

```yaml
uses: bomctl/bomctl-action@v0.0.1
with:
  bomctl-version: v0.4.1 # optional
```

## Options

### `bomctl-version`

The version of `bomctl` to install. Can be a tagged release, commit SHA, branch name, or "latest".
A step using the `actions/setup-go` action must be executed before this action when specifying a
branch name or commit SHA.
